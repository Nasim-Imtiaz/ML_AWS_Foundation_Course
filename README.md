#### Artificial Intelligence
AI refers to the broad capability of machines to perform activities using human-like intelligence. 

#### Categorical Label 
has a discrete set of possible values, such as "is cat" and "is not a cat". 

#### Clustering
Unsupervised learning task helps to determine if there are any naturally occuring groupings in the data. 

#### Component of Machine Learning
* Machine Learning Model - extremely generic program(or block of code), made specific by the data used to train it. It is used to solve different problems. ( *generic problem made specific by data* )
* Model Training Algorithm - Model training algorithms work through an interactive process. It thinks about the changes that need to be made and make those changes and repeat these process. ( *an iterative process fitting a generic model to soecific data* )
* Model Inference algorithm - generates prediction using the trained model. ( *process to use a trained model to solve a task* )

#### Continuous Label
doesn't have a discrete set of possible values, which means possibly an unlimited of possibilities. 

#### Data Portion in Machine Learning workflow
* Data Collection
* Data Inspection
  * Outliers Detection
  * Missing or Incomplete Data
  * Transform Your Dataset
* Summary Statistics
  * Trends in the data
  * Scale of the data
  * Shape of the data
* Data Visualization

#### Label Data
refers to data that already contains the solution. 

#### Machine Learning
Which allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so. Using machine learning computer learn to ***discover patterns*** and ***make predictions***. It combines statistics, applied math and computer science. 

#### Model
Model inspects data to discover patterns. Then human use the pattern learn by the model to gain new understandings or make predictions. 

#### Reinforcement Learning 
Reinforcement Learning learns through consequences of actions in an environment. Ex. training pet. The algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward on the way to reaching a specific goal. 

#### Steps in Machine Learning
* Defining the problem
* Building the dataset
* Training the model
* Evaluating the model
* Using the model

#### Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning technique in which every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. Supervised learning algorithms learn to predict labels or output values. ***Regression*** and ***Classification*** are supervised leraning. 

#### Unlabeled Data
means you don't need to provide the model with any kind of label or solution while the model is being trained. 

#### Unsupervised Learning 
Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning technique in which there is no labels for training data. Unsupervised algorithms try to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.
